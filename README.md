# Hpad-Text-Editor
A text editing application created using python GUI module tkinter.

To use this application either  
1] Download the Hpad.py file, icon2 file and icon.ico file and run Hpad.py. Both the files and folder must be in the same directory.  
2] Download the .msi installer and install the apllication

Compared to the default text editor, this application is very lacking. It was only a proof of concept for myself and an excuse to learn how to create a desktop application with python and convert it into an installable cross platform application.
